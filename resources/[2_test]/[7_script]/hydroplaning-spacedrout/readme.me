# Hydroplaning Script for FiveM

SGN https://discord.gg/NRNnvSux6e

## Description
This script adds a realistic hydroplaning effect to vehicles in FiveM. When driving at high speeds during specific weather conditions, vehicles (both players and AI) may lose grip temporarily, simulating hydroplaning. The script is fully configurable.

---

## Features
- Hydroplaning effect based on speed and weather conditions.
- Affects both player and AI vehicles.
- Configurable speed threshold, grip loss duration, and weather conditions.

---

## Configuration
You can configure the script by modifying the `Config` table in `client.lua`:

- **SpeedThreshold**: Speed (in MPH) at which hydroplaning can occur.
- **GripLossDuration**: Duration (in milliseconds) for which grip is lost.
- **WeatherConditions**: List of weather types that trigger hydroplaning. Default conditions:
  - `RAIN`
  - `THUNDER`

---

## Installation
1. Download the script and place it in your server's `resources` folder. Use a folder name like `sgn-hydroplaning`.
2. Ensure the folder structure looks like this:
    ```plaintext
    resources/
    └── sgn-hydroplaning/
        ├── fxmanifest.lua
        ├── client.lua
    ```
3. Add the script to your `server.cfg` file:
    ```plaintext
    ensure sgn-hydroplaning
    ```
4. Restart your server or run the following commands in the server console:
    ```plaintext
    refresh
    start sgn-hydroplaning
    ```

---

## How It Works
1. The script constantly checks the player's speed and weather conditions.
2. If the speed exceeds the threshold and the weather matches a condition in `WeatherConditions`, the vehicle loses grip for the specified duration.
3. AI vehicles are also affected by the same logic.
